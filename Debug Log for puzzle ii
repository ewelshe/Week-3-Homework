FOR DRAWING 1:
void setup(){
  size (500,500);
  background (255);
}
void draw(){
  int x=10;
 while (x<480){
  rect(10,10,5,5);
  fill(0);
  x=x+10;

}
}

I expected the code to draw a row of black squares
The code drew only 1 square in the upper right corner
I realized that I did not put x into the equation so it isnt creating any new squares or adding x
I then replaced the x1 position (10) with "x"! 
This worked! I created a row of squares. 
These squares are a little small, I want to make them bigger so im going to increase their size. 
 while (x<480){
  rect(x,10,10,10);
  fill(0);
  x=x+10;
When I did this it created a black line instead
I think this is because I now need to increase the spacing between it so I think I need to increase x and the x1 and y1
This worked! now they are bigger and evenly spaced again.
I now need to create a grid of the squares. I think I need to add another while statement. 

void draw(){
  int y=10;
  int x=10;
 while (x<480){
  rect(x,20,10,10);
  fill(0);
  x=x+20;
while (y<480){
  rect (x,y,10,10);
  fill(0);
  x=x+20;
}
}
}
I put in this code and all of my squares dissapeared. 
I then realized I put x instead of y in the last line. It then created a strange line of rectangles on the side
I think I need to change the equation for y
I then changed the y int to 20 so it starts below the first row
Now I need to make it repeat so it creates a grid.
void setup(){
  size (500,500);
  background (255);
}
void draw(){
  int y=20;
  int x=10;
 while (x<480){
  rect(x,20,10,10);
  fill(0);
  x=x+20;
 }
while (y<480){
  rect (10,y,10,10);
  fill(0);
  y=y+20;
}
}
